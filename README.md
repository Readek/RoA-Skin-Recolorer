<h1 align="center">RoA-Skin-Recolorer</h1>


Uses the Rivals of Aether's color codes to return a recolored character image.

Go [here](https://readek.github.io/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/) to try it out.

Can also recolor any image with the same colors as the character (for example, spritesheets).

Absa's `body` part and Kragg's `rock` part will never give correct values. I have no idea why.

Sometimes, result image will not have 100% correct rgb values respect to the ingame colors (having +-1/+-2 difference). I am not sure why this is happening, but it's generally not visible to the human eye.
