Uses Rivals of Aether's color codes to return a recolored character image.

Go [here](https://readek.github.io/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/) to try it out.

Can also recolor any user uploaded image and customize the shader inside the webpage to make it work.

Values used for character data and the shader itself are the same as the official ones. If theres anything that doesn't exactly match in-game values, please let me know!

Dreamscape shader does color degradation correctly, however, stars are not positioned exactly like ingame.

I'm open to add extra portraits for any character! If you got something, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/pulls).

You will also find documentation for [custom characters](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/blob/main/Docs/Custom%20Characters.md), [skin codes](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/blob/main/Docs/Custom%20Skins.md) and [recolorable stages](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/blob/main/Docs/Stages.md) in the `Docs` folder!

If your device can't run WebGL2 for any reason, you can use the old [Recolorer v1](https://readek.github.io/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/v1/).
