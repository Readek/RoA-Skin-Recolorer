# RoA-Skin-Recolorer
Uses the Rivals of Aether's color codes to return a recolored character image.

Go [here](https://readek.github.io/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/) to try it out.

Can also recolor any image with the same colors as the character (for example, spritesheets).

Result image may not have 100% correct rgb values. May be rounding and/or bad calculations, not sure.
