Uses Rivals of Aether's color codes to return a recolored character image.

Go [here](https://readek.github.io/RoA-Skin-Recolorer/) to try it out.

Can also recolor any user uploaded image and customize the shader inside the webpage to make it work.

**Absa**'s `body` part and **Kragg**'s `rock` part have a non-default ingame blend value (that i cant know of without the source code of the game, so i set them at 120%), meaning that the default render you can see before the first recolor won't have the same colors as the original image.

Kragg's `rock` part will usually give slightly wrong values.
