# RoA-Skin-Recolorer
Uses the Rivals of Aether's color codes to return a recolored character image.

Final images may have 2/-2 difference for the rgb values respect to the ingame colors. May be rounding and/or bad calculations, not sure.

Can also recolor any image with the same colors as the character (for example, spritesheets).

Currently WIP, more (base) characters will be added.
